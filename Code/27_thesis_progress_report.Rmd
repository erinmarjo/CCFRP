# Data Cleaning

For full details of cleaning the dataset including the 2020 data, see [this page](https://erinmarjo.github.io/CCFRP/30_full_master_df_creation.html), and for building cross correlation figures, see [this page](https://erinmarjo.github.io/CCFRP/25b_DATA_incorporate_2020.html)

# Importance of MHW Years

If marine heatwave years have a disproportionately important impact on the correlation between CPUE and MOCI for juvenile blue rockfish, excluding those year will lower the correlation.

To ensure that these correlations were not lower simply because data were missing, three other years were excluded from cross correlation.

Multiple sets of years were excluded. For full representation, click [here](https://erinmarjo.github.io/CCFRP/28_DATA_year_exclusion.html)
